        Village life signifies a close-knit community and a simple lifestyle. It is known to be calm and pure as people are closer to the nature in villages; however, it also has its own set of challenges. It can be isolating, and there may not be as many opportunities for social interaction and entertainment as there are in larger towns and cities.<br>
        <br><mark>Though, the people living in village areas lead a peaceful life, they are devoid of many modern amenities that make life comfortable.</mark> Traditional village life is devoid of the comforts that a city life offers.Though, today almost every village is well connected with roads; transportation is still scarce and if present, is of poor quality. Light and water might not be an issue for modern village, but they lack behind the cities on availability of other civic amenities. Villages have poor drainage system and no waste disposal mechanism at all, making the residents more prone to diseases and infections. On top of that, poor health care facilities add to the villagers woes.<br>
        <br>People living in the villages mostly indulge in agricultural activities and stay away from the hustle and bustle of the chaotic city life. They lead a simple life. A day in the life of a villager starts early morning. People usually wake up around 5 am and start with their daily chores. Since most of the people in the villages sleep on their roofs they are woken up as the day light breaks. They may even be woken up by the crowing of rooster.
